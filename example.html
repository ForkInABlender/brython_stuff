This was created to template minecraft textures of a character. It could also be used to find out the box layout of each texture for each item you
 are implementing. This allows for 2d representations of data to be mapped to 3d wire meshes.

The following bit ```texture = THREE.Texture.new(canvas); material = THREE.MeshBasicMaterial.new({"map": texture})``` will allow one to take that
 canvas data and set it as a texture. All textures for it can be stitched to the same object. In this case, it allows one to take images and 
  map a small portion of their data to be used for texturing instead of the entire image itself.

This allows one to define their own version of minecraft that, when used with flask, zerorpc or the like, and jython, most of the rest is
 making sure one doesn't make have a class name that matches one jython uses for its module scopes; beyond that, it's connect-the-dots.
